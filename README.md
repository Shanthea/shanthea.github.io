  <summary><h3> Shanthea's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
In 2010, I embarked on an extraordinary journey—a full-tuition academic scholarship that propelled me from a small cay with fewer than 200 inhabitants, nestled within the Exuma chain of islands with a population of about 7,000, to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. It was a step closer to fulfilling my lifelong dreams.

During my college years, I delved into various coding languages and concepts, immersing myself in Java, C++, C, Object-Oriented Programming, HTML, and more. Graduating in 2014, I was eager to leap into real-world projects.

Returning home, I faced limited tech opportunities. So, I carved my own space. I noticed my church's website needed a revamp and took it upon myself as a personal project. The outcome impressed the church office, leading to a new role overseeing operations and media at five churches. Although fulfilling, I craved more challenge and practical experience in the field.

In 2017, I pursued a career shift as an IT Specialist in another Caribbean country. Here, I honed skills in languages like Python and SQL for task-specific applications. Unfortunately, personal tragedy brought me back home.

For the following years, my focus shifted to photography, graphic design, and networking, seeking a field that challenged me and allowed for impactful work. The opportunity to work on a site at my current job rekindled my passion for coding. Eager to deepen my skills, I enrolled in a Web Development bootcamp, completing courses in CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and delving into Javascript with plans to explore frameworks like REACT, Angular, and other critical web development concepts. Simultaneously, I'm sharpening my Python skills, recognizing the importance of practice in honing implementation.

Excitement brews within me as I foresee a promising career in coding. It seems I've finally found my professional niche, a place where invention, creativity, and impactful work intertwine—a home in the world of programming.
